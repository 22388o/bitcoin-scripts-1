# Bitcoin Scripts
What's possible in Bitcoin's transaction scripting language? A chaotic compilation of exotic bitcoin scripts.

Examples:
- [Betcoins](betcoins.md)
- [Rock Paper Scissors](rock-paper-scissors.md)
- [Composite Opcodes](composite-opcodes.md)
- [Integer Commitments](integer-commitments.md)
- [Make sense of OP_CODESEPERATOR](op-codeseparator.md)

and more.

There's also a primitive [Script Editor](https://coins.github.io/bitcoin-scripts/script-editor). It simplifies editing of Bitcoin Scripts with repeating OP_CODE patterns.

Note: In many examples we're using the [Bitcoin Script Debugger](https://github.com/kallewoof/btcdeb). It's a great tool for debugging bitcoin scripts.
