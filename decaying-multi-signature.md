# Decaying Multisignature 

A 3-of-5 bitcoin multisig, that after 60 months decays into a 2-of-5, and after 66 months decays into a 1-of-5.
 
It makes it easy for the user to secure only 5 keys while at the same time allowing the user to lose 4 keys and still recover funds.
The downside is you need to move funds every 5 years, but I think thatâ€™s reasonable to avoid 2 extra keys to secure.

## Basic Idea
```
IF
  3
ELSE
  IF
    "60 months" CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY DROP
    2
  ELSE
    "66 months" CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY DROP
    1
  ENDIF
ENDIF


<pubkey_1> <pubkey_2> <pubkey_3> <pubkey_4> <pubkey_5> 5 CHECKMULTISIG
```

### A Small Optimization
We can optimize the above code a bit to save two opcodes:
```
IF
  3
ELSE
  IF
    2
    "60 months" 
  ELSE
    1
    "66 months"
  ENDIF
  CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY DROP
ENDIF


<pubkey_1> <pubkey_2> <pubkey_3> <pubkey_4> <pubkey_5> 5 CHECKMULTISIG
```
